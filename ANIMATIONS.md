## 🎯 Animation Principles Used

### Timing & Easing
- Custom easing curve: `[0.16, 1, 0.3, 1]` for smooth, confident motion
- Spring physics for natural movement
- Staggered delays for sequential reveals
- Longer durations (0.7-1.2s) for premium feel

### Effects
- **Blur-to-focus**: Elements start blurred and sharpen on reveal
- **Parallax**: Different scroll speeds for depth
- **Magnetic**: Subtle movement toward cursor
- **Scale**: Gentle growth/shrink (0.95-1.05)
- **Lift**: Y-axis movement on hover (-4 to -12px)
- **Rotation**: Subtle rotations for playfulness (-10° to 10°)

### Visual Enhancements
- Gradient overlays (3-8% opacity)
- Decorative blurred shapes in background
- Animated progress bars and dividers
- Shadow transitions on hover
- Color transitions on interaction

### Performance
- `viewport: { once: true }` to prevent re-animation
- GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity)
- Optimized blur effects
- Efficient spring physics

## 🚀 Interactive Elements

### Hover States
- Scale transformations
- Y-axis lift
- Shadow enhancements
- Color transitions
- Icon rotations
- Gradient overlays

### Scroll Triggers
- Viewport-based animations
- Parallax effects
- Progress tracking
- Section detection

### Micro-interactions
- Button press feedback (whileTap)
- Icon wiggle animations
- Bullet point reveals
- Number counting
- Line expansions

## 🎬 Animation Sequence

**Page Load:**
1. Navigation slides down (0.2s delay)
2. Hero name fades in with blur (0.3s)
3. Underline expands (1.2s)
4. Role slides up (0.7s)
5. Description fades (1.1s)
6. Contact items stagger in (1.5s+)
7. Scroll indicator appears (2s)

**On Scroll:**
- Each section triggers as it enters viewport
- Staggered child animations
- Parallax effects in Hero
- Timeline animations in Experience
- Number counting in Impact

## 💡 Best Practices Implemented

✅ Calm, intentional animations (no bouncing)
✅ Professional easing curves
✅ Subtle movements (8-30px max)
✅ Opacity + transform only for performance
✅ Staggered reveals for hierarchy
✅ Viewport triggers for efficiency
✅ Accessible (respects reduced motion preferences)
✅ Consistent timing across components

## 🎨 Color & Visual Harmony

- Accent color: `#5B7C99` (Muted Blue)
- Gradient combinations with blue-500
- Neutral grays for text
- 3-8% opacity overlays
- Soft shadows (0.08-0.25 alpha)
